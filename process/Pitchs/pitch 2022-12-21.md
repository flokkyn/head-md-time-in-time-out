# Testing Day

Today I learnt what I have to fix to make my project working. That's some kind of things I already know but it cleared it.

My project was a bit different between the morning and the afternoon.

My paper questionnaire was cool and clear. People liked to use my object without seeing it and only trying to touch it and discovered the texture.
So I know I have to put more textures on Fusion360 to allowed people to touch more, as stim toys were an inspiration for me:

However people were a bit confused when it came to take care of the object. They understood that they have to do some caress or any actions when it started to vibrate.

Nevertheless, the morning was clearer on this point than the afternoon. Because I asked them to take care of the object in a square with limited movements.

 In the afternoon I asked them to do a walk and to take care of the object, 2/3 of people walked with it without trying any actions on it, so it was always the same vibration.The last one did many things with it, so he obtained more interactions.

I don't know if I should make the fossil more independant because I have the impression that my projection is gonna lose their interest if I do that.
